# World-Happiness-Report-Analysis

## Introduction
This portfolio includes Python code that I created while completing CareerFoundry's Data Analytics course between 2022 and 2023. Open-source data from the World Happiness Report between 2012 and 2022 were examined to analyze global and regional trends. The findings were presented in a Tableau dashboard: ttps://public.tableau.com/app/profile/charles.yi/viz/WorldHappinessReport_16904106645880/Dashboard1?publish=yes 

## UPLOADS
The uploads comprise several Jupyter notebooks containing Python code used for data and exploratory analysis, as well as the creation of visuals such as scatterplots, histograms, and bar charts.

## DATA
The dataset used for this project is from the Sustainable Development Solutions Network - a UN agency that publishes the annual World Happiness Report. The data contained ten years of data spanning 2012 and 2022 and included variables such as Life Ladder, Log GDP Per Capita, and Social Support for countries that participated in the survey. A geojson file was added to the original dataset for geospatial analysis and visualizations.
